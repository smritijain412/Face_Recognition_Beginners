# Face_Recognition_Beginners
Face Recognition is a recognition technique used to detect faces of individuals whose images saved in the data set. Despite the point that other methods of identification can be more accurate, face recognition has always remained a significant focus of research because of its non-meddling nature and because it is peopleâ€™s facile method of personal identification.
# Face Recognition works:-
There are many ways for face recognition. Here we use OpenCV for face recognition. In face recognition, the image first prepared for preprocessing and then trained the face recogniser to recognise the faces. After teaching the recogniser, we test the recogniser to see the results.
